# Nexbuss
## Andrew Borondia

This is a project I made during my time in the Software Developer course at the Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology.
It uses the [Winnipeg Transit API](https://api.winnipegtransit.com/) to find information on buses that will be stopping at a specific stop, which can be searched based on the street name.
