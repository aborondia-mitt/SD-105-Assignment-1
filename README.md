# Nexbuss
## Andrew Borondia

This is a project I made during my time in the Software Developer course at the Manitoba Institute of Trades and Technology.
It uses the Winnipeg Transit API to find information on buses that will be stopping at a specific stop, which can be searched based on the street name.
